        "description": " An agricultural baler is an agri tool or implement used to compress a cut and scrape crop into a compact or suitable size. A baler, when used as a tractor attachment, converts agricultural wastes such as hay and flax straws into bales that can then be used for a variety of purposes such as haylage and animal feed. When crop residue is in a baler, it is easier to transport and store it. It helps you save money, time, and space by reducing trash production by 80 percent. Furthermore, it reduces the risk of fires.",
